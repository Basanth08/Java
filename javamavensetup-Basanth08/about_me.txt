My name is Basanth Varaganti. Im from India. I live in Telangana which is towards the southern part of India. I dont have any prior experience with Java as i have changed my Majors from Electronics and communication to Data Science. I'm confident enough that i will do my best and I'm sure that my professor and my TA's are always there to help me.
