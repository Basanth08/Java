## 🌟 Key Components

### Data Structures Implementation
```java
// Example: Advanced Binary Search Tree Implementation
public class AVLTree<T extends Comparable<T>> {
    private Node root;
    
    private class Node {
        T data;
        Node left, right;
        int height;
        
        Node(T data) {
            this.data = data;
            this.height = 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Advanced balancing and rotation methods
    private Node balance(Node node) {
        // Implementation of AVL tree balancing
        // with sophisticated rotation logic
    }
}
```

### Concurrent Programming
```java
// Example: Thread-Safe Producer-Consumer Implementation
public class ThreadSafeQueue<T> {
    private final Queue<T> queue;
    private final ReentrantLock lock;
    private final Condition notEmpty;
    private final Condition notFull;
    
    public void put(T item) throws InterruptedException {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (queue.size() == capacity) {
                notFull.await();
            }
            queue.add(item);
            notEmpty.signal();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```
