What happens when you change the amount of time that the turnip dropper waits between drops? 
What if you reduce it to 0? Why do you think that is?

One benefit of decreasing the duration is that the programme operates more quickly overall
because we don't have to wait for the turnips to drop each time. Second, the goats start to 
distribute turnips in a more uniform manner. This could be because there is no longer
any delay, so all of the goats are attempting to get to the turnips at the same moment, 
which prevents the synchronisation effect from happening.

What happens if you change the number of turnips that are dropped at a time to a higher number, e.g. 5 or 10? 
Why do you think that is?

Since the same goat will consume all the turnips until it is empty, there is a greater likelihood that it will
consume every turnip. This implies that there will be fewer opportunities for the other goats to unblock
themselves in between turnip drop iterations.
